## Introduction
In this project, we will go through the complete data science process using the California housing prices dataset from Kaggle. The steps include exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, engineering custom features, training models, and evaluating their performance. This guide is intended for beginners in data science and machine learning, but it also introduces some advanced concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Working IPython notebook environment (Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or IPython notebooks in VS Code/PyCharm)
- Basic data science libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Data Overview
The dataset contains features like coordinates, median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, and households, with the target variable being the median house
